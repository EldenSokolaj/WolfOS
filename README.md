# WolfOS
A simple OS built mainly in c++, still in progress if you want to help

Currently the latest working (non crashing) version is 0.4 and the current in progress version is 0.4

Although in reality most versions appear to be exactly the same, they are not.

That being said though I would be more than open to suggestions or contributions, for now mainly towards the GDT and IDT
